    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a computer system. It is designed to provide a centralized location for storing and managing data, making it easy to access and manipulate that data as needed. Databases can be used for a wide range of applications, from managing customer data in a business to storing scientific data for research purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL databases are two different types of databases that have different approaches to managing and organizing data. Here's how they differ:\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use a structured schema to define the tables, columns, and relationships between the data. They are based on the relational model and are designed to store and manage structured data. SQL databases are ideal for applications where data needs to be structured and organized, such as in finance, human resources, and e-commerce. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "# NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that use a dynamic schema to define the data. They are designed to store and manage unstructured or semi-structured data, such as text, documents, and multimedia. NoSQL databases are ideal for applications where data needs to be flexible and scalable, such as in social media, gaming, and big data analytics. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between SQL and NoSQL databases is that SQL databases are structured and relational, while NoSQL databases are unstructured and non-relational. The choice between the two types of databases depends on the nature of the data and the requirements of the application being developed."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a set of SQL statements used to define the structure of a database and the objects within it. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some common DDL statements and their uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create a new database object, such as a table, index, or view. For example, the following statement creates a new table named \"customers\" with columns for customer ID, name, and email:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE customers (\n",
    "  id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "  name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "  email VARCHAR(100)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP: The DROP statement is used to remove an existing database object, such as a table or view. For example, the following statement drops the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. For example, the following statement adds a new column called \"phone\" to the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers ADD phone VARCHAR(20);\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to delete all data from a table without deleting the table itself. For example, the following statement removes all data from the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DDL statements are used to define the structure of a database and the objects within it. The CREATE statement is used to create new objects, the DROP statement is used to delete objects, the ALTER statement is used to modify objects, and the TRUNCATE statement is used to remove data from tables."

    "\n",
    "UPDATE customers SET email = 'gouravpatil@gmail.com' WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DELETE: The DELETE statement is used to remove data from a table. For example, the following statement deletes the record with an ID of 1 from the \"customers\" table:\n",
